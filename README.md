We use a proprietary data set to describe the market of private pay senior housing and community-level characteristics in 140 metropolitan statistical areas, from 2015 to 2019. Although the number of senior housing communities increased substantially, the supply of senior housing options supporting the continuum of care has not necessarily kept up with population growth.
